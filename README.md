# Employee Management System (Java Spring Boot + React CRUD)

This project implements a full-stack Employee Management System using Java Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL as the database, and React with Bootstrap and Axios for the frontend. The system allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employees.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new employees with their details.
- **Read:** View a list of all employees with their information.
- **Update:** Modify existing employee details.
- **Delete:** Remove employees from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - **Java Spring Boot:** Java Spring Boot is used for building the backend server of the application. Spring Boot provides a powerful platform for developing Java-based web applications with ease. It simplifies the configuration and setup of Spring-based applications, allowing developers to focus more on application logic.
  - **MySQL:** MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system. It is used as the database for storing employee information in this project. MySQL provides a robust and scalable solution for managing relational data.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it suitable for building complex and interactive web applications.
  - **Bootstrap:** Bootstrap is a front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a set of CSS and JavaScript components that help developers design consistent and visually appealing user interfaces.
  - **Axios:** Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making AJAX requests in the browser and Node.js. It is used in this project for sending HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Spring Boot backend.
